# hi
My name is [Isabelle Park](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lplh8UYa4IKhBfJaEvLsbNISXatD1fTLwHyNMo_hxns/edit?usp=sharing) I am currently a senior at Del Norte High School, and my favorite classes I've taken in high school are ceramics, calculus, and APEL. My favorite subject in school is math because it is pretty straightforward with an answer, but you can also find this answer multiple different ways. A few of my hobbies include drawing or just art in general, playing the piano, reading, listening to music, and playing games. 
Here is a photo of my dog:

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 
- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
